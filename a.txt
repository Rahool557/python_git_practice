The white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae) is 
a passerine bird in the swallow family. First found in 1968, it is known 
only from a single wintering site in Thailand, and may be extinct, since there have been no confirmed sightings
since 1980 despite targeted surveys in Thailand and Cambodia. The adult has mainly glossy greenish-black 
plumage, a white rump, and a tail with two long central feathers that widen to a racket-shaped tip. 
It has a white eye ring and a broad, bright greenish-yellow bill. The juvenile lacks the tail ornaments
and is browner. Like other swallows, it feeds on insects caught in flight, and its wide bill suggests that it 
may take relatively large species. It roosts in reed beds in winter, and may nest in river sandbanks.
Its apparent demise may have been hastened by trapping, loss of habitat and dam construction. 
The martin is one of only two birds endemic to Thailand. The country's government has featured the bird
on a stamp and a commemorative coin.
